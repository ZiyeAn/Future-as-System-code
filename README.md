# Future As System

## Introduction

**Problems:**
- lack of instant mushroom identifier app (iNaturist, Plantiary)
- Combine recipe function together (where my interest in mushroom comes from)
- canâ€™t get instant knowledge while out foraging it.
**Idea:**
- image recognition
- recipe generator


## Ideation

**BACKEND:**
- build an API using Google AI lab
- taking the images from frontend as input and setting prompt to get the mushroom info and recipe
- setting API endpoints

**FRONTEND:**
- taking the input from users(images)
- making request to the API I made with Gemini process the responses into right format
- insert the responses orderly into html
- adding more interactive elements
